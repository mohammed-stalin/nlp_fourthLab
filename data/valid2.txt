Rules of society are nothing  one's conscience is the umpire.
No matter how lovesick a woman is  she shouldn't take the first pill that comes along.
Form the habit of making decisions when your spirit is fresh ... to let dark moods lead is like choosing cowards to command armies.
One must either accept some theory or else believe one's own instinct or follow the world's opinion.
Decide which is the line of conduct that presents the fewest drawbacks and then follow it out as being the best one  because one never finds anything perfectly pure and unmixed  or exempt from danger.
A problem clearly stated is a problem half solved.
We must make the choices that enable us to fulfill the deepest capacities of our real selves.
Choose always the way that seems the best  however rough it may be  custom will soon render it easy and agreeable.
Where an opinion is general  it is usually correct.
In forty hours I shall be in battle  with little information  and on the spur of the moment will have to make the most momentous decisions. But I believe that one's spirit enlarges with responsibility and that  with God's help  I shall make them  and make them right.
Once the "what" is decided  the "how" always follows. We must not make the "how" an excuse for not facing and accepting the "what."
In each action we must look beyond the action at our past  present and future state  and at others whom it affects  and see the relation of all those things. And then we shall be very cautious.
One's mind has a way of making itself up in the background  and it suddenly becomes clear what one means to do.
Not all of your decisions will be correct. None of us is perfect. But if you get into the habit of making decisions  experience will develop your judgment to a point where more and more of your decisions will be right. After all  it is better to be right 51 percent of the time and get something done  than it is to get nothing done because you fear to reach a decision.
Decide on what you think is right  and stick to it.
Continually one faces the horrible matter of making decisions. The solution ... is  as far as possible  to avoid conscious rational decisions and choices  simply to do what you find yourself doing  to float in the great current of life with as little friction as possible  to allow things to settle themselves  as indeed they do with the most infallible certainty.
When making a decision of minor importance  I have always found it advantageous to consider all the pros and cons. In vital matters  however  such as the choice of a mate or a profession  the decision should come from the unconscious  from somewhere within ourselves. In the important decisions of personal life  we should be governed  I think  by the deep inner needs of our nature.
Pick battles big enough to matter  small enough to win.
Wisdom consists in being able to distinguish among dangers and make a choice of the least harmful.
I think we should follow a simple rule: if we can take the worst  take the risk.
Human foresight often leaves its proudest possessor only a choice of evils.
When one bases his life on principle  99 percent of his decisions are already made.
The best we can do is size up the chances  calculate the risks involved  estimate our ability to deal with them  and then make our plans with confidence.
In case of doubt  decide in favor of what is correct.
Each man must for himself alone decide what is right and what is wrong  which course is patriotic and which isn't. You cannot shirk this and be a man. To decide against your conviction is to be an unqualified and inexcusable traitor  both to yourself and to your country  let men label you as they may.
People "died" all the time. ... Parts of them died when they made the wrong kinds of decisions-decisions against life. Sometimes they died bit by bit until finally they were just living corpses walking around. If you were perceptive you could see it in their eyes  the fire had gone out ... you always knew when you made a decision against life. ... The door clicked and you were safe inside- safe and dead.
What I emphasize is for people to make choices based not on fear  but on what really gives them a sense of fulfillment.
We lose the fear of making decisions  great and small  as we realize that should our choice prove wrong we can  if we will  learn from the experience.
History is a stern judge.
I get a little angry about this highhanded scrapping of the look of things. What else have we to go by? How else can the average person form an opinion of a girl's sense of values or even of her chastity except by the looks of her conduct?
You wouldn't want to be caught wearing cheap perfume  would you? Then why do you want to wear cheap perfume on your conduct?
The difference between weakness and wickedness is much less than people suppose  and the consequences are nearly always the same.
Authority without wisdom is like a heavy axe without an edge  fitter to bruise than to polish.
One faces the future with one's past.
Our deeds still travel with us from afar  and what we have been makes us what we are.
You must not change one thing  one pebble  one grain of sand  until you know what good and evil will follow on that act.
The beginning of compunction is the beginning of a new life.
The Pilgrims didn't have any experience when they landed here. Hell  if experience was that important  we'd never have anybody walking on the moon.
Each person has a literature inside them. But when people lose language  when they have to experiment with putting their thoughts together on the spot-that's what I love most. That's where character lives.
There is no data on the future.
The most important fact about Spaceship Earth: an instruction book didn't come with it.
Life is the only art that we are required to practice without preparation  and without being allowed the preliminary trials  the failures and botches  that are essential for the training of a mere beginner.
Time has told me less than I need to know.
I learn by going where I have to go.
Life is like playing a violin in public and learning the instrument as one goes on.
We don't have enough time to premeditate all our actions.
Every year  if not every day  we have to wager our salvation upon some prophecy based upon imperfect knowledge.
Faith ... acts promptly and boldly on the occasion  on slender evidence.
A decision is an action you must take when you have information so incomplete that the answer does not suggest itself.
She knew in her heart that to be without optimism  that core of reasonless hope in the spirit  rather than the brain  was a fatal flaw  the seed of death.
When faith is supported by facts or by logic it ceases to be faith.
How far would Moses have gone if he had taken a poll in Egypt?
Better to be without logic than without feeling.
The will to be totally rational is the will to be made out of glass and steel: and to use others as if they were glass and steel.
In the three years I played ball  we won six  lost seventeen and tied two. Some statistician ... calculated that we won 75 percent of the games we didn't lose.
Imagination took the reins  and Reason  slow-paced  though surefooted  was unequal to a race with so eccentric and flighty a companion.
Many persons of high intelligence have notoriously poor judgement.
How dangerous can false reasoning prove!
The tendency of modern science is to reduce proof to absurdity by continually reducing absurdity to proof.
Say you were standing with one foot in the oven and one foot in an ice bucket. According to the percentage people  you would be perfectly comfortable.
Logic is the art of going wrong with confidence.
Reason  with most people  means their own opinions.
Logic pervades the world  the limits of the world are also the limits of logic.
Man is a reasoning  rather than a reasonable  animal.
False conclusions which have been reasoned out are infinitely worse than blind impulse.
If you do everything you should do  and do not do anything you should not do  you will  according to the best available statistics  live exactly eighteen hours longer than you would otherwise.
Decisions  particularly important ones  have always made me sleepy  perhaps because I know that I will have to make them by instinct  and thinking things out is only what other people tell me I should do.
Statistics are no substitute for judgement.
It is the heart always that sees before the head can see.
Facts are stubborn things  but statistics are more pliable.
A true history of human events would show that a far larger proportion of our acts are the result of sudden impulse and accident than of that reason of which we so much boast.
It is always thus  impaled by a state of mind which is destined not to last  that we make our irrevocable decisions.
A power greater than any human being helped make this decision.
He who reflects too much will achieve little.
The opportunity is often lost by deliberating.
The percentage of mistakes in quick decisions is no greater than in long-drawn-out vacillations  and the effect of decisiveness itself "makes things go" and creates confidence.
Deliberation often loses a good chance.
The mania of thinking renders one unfit for every activity.
When possible make the decisions now  even if action is in the future. A revised decision usually is better than one reached at the last moment.
We spend our days in deliberating  and we end them without coming to any resolve.
If you think too long  you think wrong.
You decide you'll wait for your pitch. Then as the ball starts toward the plate  you think about your stance. And then you think about your swing. And then you realize that the ball that went past you for a strike was your pitch.
The soul of dispatch is decision.
The moment a question comes to your mind  see yourself mentally taking hold of it and disposing of it. In that moment... you learn to become the decider and not the vacillator. Thus you build character.
So what do we do? Anything. Something. So long as we just don't sit there. If we screw it up  start over. Try something else. If we wait until we've satisfied all the uncertainties  it may be too late.
Often greater risk is involved in postponement than in making a wrong decision.
Some persons are very decisive when it comes to avoiding decisions.
Do not wait for ideal circumstances  nor the best opportunities  they will never come.
There comes a time when you've got to say  "Let's get off our asses and go ..." I have always found that if I move with 75 percent or more of the facts I usually never regret it. It's the guys who wait to have everything perfect that drive you crazy.
Conditions are never just right. People who delay action until all factors are favorable do nothing.
Common sense does not ask an impossible chessboard  but takes the one before it and plays the game.
He who postpones the hour of living is like the rustic who waits for the river to run out before he crosses.
If you wait for inspiration you'll be standing on the corner after the parade is a mile down the street.
Nothing at all will be attempted if all possible objections must first be overcome.
It is the characteristic excellence of the strong man that he can bring momentous issues to the fore and make a decision about them. The weak are always forced to decide between alternatives they have not chosen themselves.
Alternatives  and particularly desirable alternatives  grow only on imaginary trees.
The more one does and sees and feels  the more one is able to do  and the more genuine may be one's own appreciation of fundamental things like home  and love  and understanding companionship.
Our danger is not too few  but too many options ... to be puzzled by innumerable alternatives.
The absence of alternatives clears the mind marvelously.
I couldn't claim that I have never felt the urge to explore evil  but when you descend into hell you have to be very careful.
If decisions were a choice between alternatives  decisions would come easy. Decision is the selection and formulation of alternatives.
You cannot have your cake and eat it.
It is better to arm and strengthen your hero  than to disarm and enfeeble your foe.
You cannot sell the cow and sup the milk.
There is only one answer to destruc-tiveness and that is creativity.
A door must either be shut or open.
Here's a rule I recommend. Never practice two vices at once.
You cannot serve God and Mammon.
Between two stools one sits on the ground.
When you cannot make up your mind between two evenly balanced courses of action  choose the bolder.
When confronted with two courses of action I jot down on a piece of paper all the arguments in favor of each one  then on the opposite side I write the arguments against each one. Then by weighing the arguments pro and con and cancelling them out  one against the other  I take the course indicated by what remains.
There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.
You cannot have it both ways.
I would sort out all the arguments and see which belonged to fear and which to creativeness. Other things being equal  I would make the decision which had the larger number of creative reasons on its side.
Of two evils  choose the less.
Of two evils  choose the prettier.
Where bad's the best  bad must be the choice.
Both choices are painful  but only one is therapeutic.
God offers to every mind its choice between truth and repose. Take which you please-you can never have both.
Necessity relieves us from the embarrassment of choice.
When you have to make a choice and don't make it  that is in itself a choice.
A man without decision can never be said to belong to himself  he is as a wave of the sea  or a feather in the air which every breeze blows about.
Nothing is so exhausting as indecision  and nothing is so futile.
Not to decide is to decide.
Decision is a sharp knife that cuts clean and straight  indecision  a dull one that hacks and tears and leaves ragged edges behind it.
There is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision.
In not making the decision  you've made one. Not doing something is the same as doing it.
There is a time when we must firmly choose the course we will follow  or the relentless drift of events will make the decision for us.
You can only predict things after they've happened.
It is the mark of a good action that it appears inevitable  in retrospect.
No one knows what he can to do until he tries.
Of all paths a man could strike into  there is  at any given moment  a best path which  here and now  it were of all things wisest for him to do. To find this path  and walk in it  is the one thing needful for him.
Decisions  particularly important ones  have always made me sleepy  perhaps because I know that I will have to make them by instinct  and thinking things out is only what other people tell me I should do.
After a battle is over people talk a lot about how decisions were methodically reached  but actually there's always a hell of a lot of groping around.
No question is ever settled until it is settled right.
No man who has not sat in the assemblies of men can know the light  odd and uncertain ways in which decisions are often arrived at.
No trumpets sound when the important decisions of our life are made. Destiny is made known silently.
A man must be able to cut a knot  for everything cannot be untied.
Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide ... And the choice goes by forever t'wixt that darkness and that light.
Necessity is not an established fact  but an interpretation.
We are not permitted to choose the frame of our destiny. But what we put into it is ours.
There is a point at which everything becomes simple and there is no longer any question of choice  because all you have staked will be lost if you look back. Life's point of no return.
Optimism is an intellectual choice.
The lame man who keeps the right road outstrips the runner who takes a wrong one ... the more active and swift the latter is  the further he will go astray.
Nothing is more difficult  and therefore more precious  than to be able to decide.
There is one quality more important than know-how.... This is know-how by which we determine not only how to accomplish our purposes  but what our purposes are to be.
Destiny is not a matter of chance  it is a matter of choice  it is not a thing to be waited for  it is a thing to be achieved.
What must be  shall be  and that which is a necessity to him that struggles is little more than choice to him that is willing.
A wiser rule would be to make up your mind soberly what you want  peace or war  and then to get ready for what you want  for what we prepare for is what we shall get.
We have resolved to endure the unendurable and suffer what is insufferable.
Once a decision was made  I did not worry about it afterward.
No country can act wisely simultaneously in every part of the globe at every moment of time.
The last  if not the greatest  of the human freedoms: to choose their own attitude in any given circumstance.
He who has a choice has trouble.
We have left undone those things which we ought to have done  and we have done those things which we ought not to have done.
Little deeds of kindness  little words of love  Make our earth an Eden like the heaven above.
Whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well.
Give me the ready hand rather than the ready tongue.
Noble deeds that are concealed are most esteemed.
Heaven ne'er helps the man who will not help himself.
Do not be afraid of defeat. You are never so near to victory as when defeated in a good cause.
To lose Is to learn.
We have fought this fight as long  and as well as we know how. We have been defeated. For us  as a Christian people  there is now but one course to pursue. We must accept the situation.
I let the American people down  and I have to carry that burden for the rest of my life. My political life is over. I will never again have an opportunity to serve in any official position. Maybe I can give a little advice from time to time.
What is defeat? Nothing but education  nothing but the first step toward something better.
Who  apart From ourselves  can see any difference between Our victories and our defeats?
They were never defeated  they were only killed.
The mountain remains unmoved at seeming defeat by the mist.
It is defeat that turns bone to flint  it is defeat that turns gristle to muscle  it is defeat that makes men invincible.
What is defeat? Nothing but education  nothing but the first step to something better.
Defeat should never be a source of discouragement but rather a fresh stimulus.
Demagogues and agitators are very unpleasant  but they are incidents to a free and constitutional country  and you must put up with these inconveniences or do without many important advantages.
In every age the vilest specimens of human nature are to be found among demagogues.
Every one that was in distress  and every one that was in debt  and every one that was discontented  gathered themselves unto him  and he became a captain over them.
A wise fellow who is also worthless always charms the rabble.
Democracy is based upon the conviction that there are extraordinary possibilities in ordinary people.
In a democracy  the opposition is not only tolerated as constitutional  but must be maintained because it is indispensable.
It has been said that Democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.
Democracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral and intellectual capacity  as well as the inalienable right  to govern himself with reason and justice.
If you want to understand democracy  spend less time in the library with Plato  and more time in the buses with people.
Democracy is a small hard core of common agreement  surrounded by a rich variety of individual differences.
People often say that  in a democracy  decisions are made by a majority of the people. Of course  that is not true. Decisions are made by a majority of those who make themselves heard and who vote - a very different thing.
Democracy means government by the uneducated  while aristocracy means government by the badly educated.
My definition of a free society is a society where it is safe to be unpopular.
It is the greatest good to the greatest number which is the measure of right and wrong.
The greatest blessing of our democracy is freedom. But in the last analysis  our only freedom is the freedom to discipline ourselves.
Democracy is the recurrent suspicion that more than half of the people are right more than half of the time.
The worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal.
What men value in the world is not rights  but privileges.
As I would not be a slave  so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy.
Democracy is a festival of mediocrity.
The job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open.
It would be folly to argue that the people cannot make political mistakes. They can and do make grave mistakes. They know it  they pay the penalty  but compared with the mistakes which have been made by every kind of autocracy they are unimportant.
Democracy is based upon the conviction that there are extraordinary possibilities in ordinary people.
The world must be made safe for democracy.
Democracy is the government of the people  by the people  for the people.
Democracy means not "I am as good as you are " but "You are as good as I am."
All the ills of democracy can be cured by more democracy.
I believe in Democracy because it releases the energies of every human being.
While democracy must have its organization and controls  its vital breath is individual liberty.
People may live as much retired from the world as they please  but sooner or later  before they are aware  they will find themselves debtor or creditor to somebody.
He who imagines he can do without the world deceives himself much  but he who fancies the world cannot do without him is still more mistaken.
It is easier to suppress the first desire than to satisfy all that follow it.
There are two tragedies in life. One is not to get your heart's desire. The other is to get it.
Our desires always increase with our possessions. The knowledge that something remains yet unenjoyed impairs our enjoyment of the good before us.
He who desires naught will always be free.
Ah love! could you and I with Him conspire To grasp this sorry scheme of things entire  Would not we shatter it to bits - and then Re-mold it nearer to the heart's desire!
Ail hope abandon  ye who enter here.
Despair is the conclusion of fools.
Despair doubles our strength.
It is the old practice of despots to use a part of the people to keep the rest in order.
Despotism can no more exist in a nation until the liberty of the press be destroyed than the night can happen before the sun is set.
I will believe in the right of one man to govern a nation despotically when I find a man born unto the world with boots and spurs  and a nation with saddles on their backs.
We are but as the instrument of Heaven. Our work is not design  but destiny.
Every man meets his Waterloo at last.
There is a divinity that shapes our ends  Rough-hew them how we will.
Here is the devil-and-all to pay.
Resist the Devil  and he will flee from you.
The devil was sick  the devil a monk would be  The devil was well  the devil a monk was he.
How art thou fallen from heaven  O Lucifer  son of the morning!
Get thee behind me  Satan.
He will give the devil his due.
The prince of darkness is a gentleman.
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
Everyone gets their rough day. No one gets a free ride. Today so far  I had a good day. I got a dial tone.
Thy fate is the common fate of all  Into each life some rain must fall  Some days must be dark and dreary.
Some days you tame the tiger. And some days the tiger has you for lunch.
Some days the dragon wins.
The one law that does not change is that everything changes  and the hardship I was bearing today was only a breath away from the pleasures I would have tomorrow  and those pleasures would be all the richer because of the memories of this I was enduring.
Experience cold or heat  pleasure or pain. These experiences are fleeting  they come and go. Bear them patiently.
To everything there is a season  A time for every purpose under heaven.... A time to weep  and a time to laugh  A time to mourn  and a time to dance.
Let nothing disturb thee  Let nothing affright thee  All things are passing  God changeth never.
This  too  shall pass.
The present will not long endure.
We do not live an equal life  but one of contrasts and patchwork  now a little joy  then a sorrow  now a sin  then a generous or brave action.
I feel successful when the writing goes well. This lasts five minutes. Once  when I was number one on the bestseller list  I also felt successful. That lasted three minutes.
Sadness and gladness succeed each other.
Sadness flies away on the wings of time.
I don't think that ... one gets a flash of happiness once  and never again  it is there within you  and it will come as certainly as death....
Life comes in clusters  clusters of solitude  then clusters when there is hardly time to breathe.
If winter comes  can spring be far behind?
Human misery must somewhere have a stop  there is no wind that always blows a storm.
No winter lasts forever  no spring skips its turn.
There are trees that seem to die at the end of autumn. There are also the evergreens.
Our Lord has written the promise of resurrection  not in books alone  but in every leaf in springtime.
For  lo  the winter is past  the rain is over and gone  the flowers appear on the earth.
If matters go badly now  they will not always be so.
Pain is never permanent.
You will suffer and you will hurt. You will have joy and you will have peace.
Pain is part of being alive  and we need to learn that. Pain does not last forever  nor is it necessarily unbearable  and we need to be taught that.
Pain is hard to bear.... But with patience  day by day  Even this shall pass away.
Everything in life that we really accept undergoes a change. So suffering must become love. That is the mystery.
I've been failing for  like  ten or eleven years. When it turns  it'll turn. Right now I'm just tryin' to squeeze through a very tight financial period  get the movie out  and put my things in order.
I've never been poor  only broke. Being poor is a frame of mind. Being broke is a temporary situation.
In the darkest hour the soul is replenished and given strength to continue and endure.
He that can't endure the bad will not live to see the good.
Our toil is sweet with thankfulness  Our burden is our boon  The curse of earth's gray morning is The blessing of its noon.
Were it possible for us to see further than our knowledge reaches  perhaps we would endure our sadnesses with greater confidence than our joys. For they are moments when something new has entered into us  something unknown.
We may draw good outof evil  we must not do evil  that good may come.
You will find a joy in overcoming obstacles.
What we call the beginning is often an end. And to make an end is to make a beginning. The end is where we start from.
When one door of happiness closes  another opens  but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.
Death is a door life opens.
The world is round  and the place which may seem like the end may also be only the beginning.
Perhaps someday it will be pleasant to remember even this.
One day in retrospect the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.
The crisis of today is the joke of tomorrow.
Sadness flies away on the wings of time.
Sometimes I found that in my happy moments I could not believe that I had ever been miserable.
If our education had included training to bear unpleasantness and to let the first shock pass until we could think more calmly  many an unbearable situation would become manageable  and many a nervous illness avoided. There is a proverb expressing this. It says  trouble is a tunnel through which we pass and not a brick wall against which we must break our head.
Time  in the turning-over of days  works change  for better or worse.
Experience is what really happens to you in the long run  the truth that finally overtakes you.
Time is like a river of fleeting events  and its current is strong  as soon as something comes into sight  it is swept past us  and something else takes its place  and that too will be swept away.
Time cools  time clarifies  no mood can be maintained quite unaltered through the course of hours.
Time bears away all things.
Come what come may  time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
Time brings all things to pass.
We undo ourselves by impatience. Misfortunes have their life and their limits  their sickness and their health.
The future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour  whatever he does  whoever he is.
That's the advantage of having lived sixty-five years. You don't feel the need to be impatient any longer.
Who longest waits most surely wins.
Patience is a bitter plant  but it has sweet fruit.
No emergency excuses you from exercising tolerance.
I believe the sign of maturity is accepting deferred gratification.
He that can have patience can have what he will.
Being human  we should bear all we can.
Adopt the pace of nature  her secret is patience.
You can't have genius without patience.
The most potent and sacred command which can be laid upon any artist is the command: wait.
How poor are they that have not patience? What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
All things come round to him who will but wait.
Panic is not an effective long-term organizing strategy.
Self-denial is painful for a moment  but very agreeable in the end.
And he shall reign a goodly king And sway his hand o'er every clime With peace writ on his signet ring  Who bides his time.
It takes time to succeed because success is merely the natural reward of taking time to do anything well.
Patience and fortitude conquer all things.
Be not afraid of growing slowly  be afraid only of standing still.
Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast.
No great thing is created suddenly  any more than a bunch of grapes or a fig. If you tell me that you desire a fig  I answer you that there must be time. Let it first blossom  then bear fruit  then ripen.
Time deals gently only with those who take it gently.
Hold on  hold fast  hold out. Patience is genius.
Genius is nothing but a greater aptitude for patience.
All human wisdom is summed up in two words: wait and hope.
Genius is eternal patience.
Serene I fold my hands and wait.
The race is not to the swift  nor the battle to the strong.
Everything comes if a man will only wait.
Everything comes to him who hustles while he waits.
The secret of patience ... to do something else in the meantime.
Have patience with all things  but chiefly have patience with yourself. Do not lose courage in considering your own imperfections  but instantly set about remedying them-every day begin the task anew.
Let us then be up and doing  With a heart for any fate  Still achieving  still pursuing  Learn to labor and to wait.
God will wait as long as it takes for us.
Waiting is not mere empty hoping. It has the inner certainty of reaching the goal.
All things come to him who waits- provided he knows what he is waiting for.
Hope and patience are two sovereign remedies for all  the surest reposals  the softest cushions to lean on in adversity.
The strongest of all warriors are these two-Time and Patience.
Who bides his time tastes the sweet Of honey in the saltiest tear  And though he fares with slowest feet Joy runs to meet him drawing near.
God grant us patience!
Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
There is nothing so bitter that a patient mind cannot find some solace for it.
Patience is the best remedy for every trouble.
For ye have need of patience....
They are ill discoverers that think there is no land  when they see nothing but sea.
The best way out of a difficulty is through it.
Many things difficult to design prove easy to performance.
A diplomat is a man who remembers a lady's birthday but forgets her age.
When a diplomat says yes he means perhaps  when he says perhaps he means no  when he says no he is no diplomat.
I have discovered the art of deceiving diplomats. I speak the truth  and they never believe me.
Diplomacy is to do and say The nastiest thing in the nicest way.
Disappointment is the nurse of wisdom.
The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men  Gang aft a-gley  And leave us nought but grief and pain  For promised joy.
Disappointments are to the soul what a thunder-storm is to the air.
Men would be angels  Angels would be gods.
Now is the Winter of our discontent.
I was born to other things.
Discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation.
Discretion in speech is more than eloquence.
A sound discretion is not so much indicated by never making a mistake as by never repeating it.
Great ability without discretion comes almost invariably to a tragic end.
Let your own discretion be your tutor  suit the action to the word  the word to the action.
The better part of valour is discretion.
Disease is the retribution of outraged Nature.
Disease is an experience of so-called mortal mind. It is fear made manifest on the body.
Desperate diseases require desperate remedies.
Some remedies are worse than the disease.
Whatever disgrace we may have deserved  it is almost always in our power to re-establish our character.
No one can disgrace us but ourselves.
Doubt the man who swears to his devotion.
Women distrust men too much in general  and too little in particular.
What loneliness is more lonely than distrust?
Doctrine is nothing but the skin of truth set up and stuffed.
How absurd to try to make two men think alike on matters of religion  when I cannot make two timepieces agree!
In religion as in politics it so happens that we have less charity for those who believe half our creed  than for diose who deny the whole of it.
You can and you can't  You will and you won't  You'll be damn'd if you do  You'll be damn'd if you don't.
"Orthodoxy  my Lord " said Bishop Warburton  in a whisper   -  "orthodoxy is my doxy   -  heterodoxy is another man's doxy."
Do not disturb the sleeping dog.

If you're a champion  you have to have it in your heart.
Human nature  if it healthy  demands excitement  and if it does not obtain its thrilling excitement in the right way  it will seek it in the wrong. God never makes bloodless stoics  He makes no passionless saints.
All passions exaggerate  it is because they do that they are passions.
If we resist our passions  it is more from their weakness than from our strength.
Be still when you have nothing to say  when genuine passion moves you  say what you've got to say  and say it hot.

Success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.
There is a passion for perfection which you rarely see fully developed  but... in successful lives it is never wholly lacking.
Many of the most successful men I have known have never grown up. They have retained bubbling-over boyishness. They have relished wit  they have indulged in humor. They have not allowed "dignity" to depress them into moroseness. Youthfulness of spirit is the twin brother of optimism  and optimism is the stuff of which American business success is fashioned. Resist growing up!

Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.
What a man accomplishes in a day depends upon the way in which he approaches his tasks. When we accept tough jobs as a challenge to our ability and wade into them with joy and enthusiasm  miracles can happen. When we do our work with a dynamic  conquering spirit  we get things done.
If you're not happy every morning when you get up  leave for work  or start to work at home-if you're not enthusiastic about doing that  you're not going to be successful.
The method of the enterprising is to plan with audacity and execute with vigor.
Do it big or stay in bed.

I prefer the errors of enthusiasm to the indifference of wisdom.
It is energy  the central element of which is will  that produces the miracles of enthusiasm in all ages. It is the mainspring of what is called force of character and the sustaining power of all great action.

Energy  even like the Biblical grain of mustard-seed  will move mountains.
Energy and persistence conquer all things.
Energy will do anything that can be done in this world.
The only thing that keeps a man going is energy. And what is energy but liking life?
No one grows old by living  only by losing interest in living.
None are so old as those who have outlived enthusiasm.
Years wrinkle the face  but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul.
He fights with spirit as well as with the sword.
It is fatal to enter any war without the will to win it.
Morale is the greatest single factor in successful wars.
The will to conquer is the first condition of victory.
The aim of military training is not just to prepare men for battle  but to make them long for it.
Wars may be fought with weapons  but they are won by men. It is the spirit of men who follow and of the man who leads that gains the victory.
Enthusiasm can only be aroused by two things: first  an ideal which takes the imagination by storm  and sec ond  a definite  intelligible plan for carrying that ideal into practice.
Earnestness and sincereness are synonymous.
Opposition inflames the enthusiast  never converts him.
No one keeps up his enthusiasm automatically. Enthusiasm must be nourished with new actions  new aspirations  new efforts  new vision. Compete with yourself  set your teeth and dive into the job of breaking your own record. It is one's own fault if his enthusiasm is gone  he has failed to feed it.
The same reason makes a man a religious enthusiast that makes a man an enthusiast in any other way ... an uncomfortable mind in an uncomfortable body.
The great composer does not set to work because he is inspired  but becomes inspired because he is working. Beethoven  Wagner  Bach and Mozart settled down day after day to the job in hand with as much regularity as an accountant settles down each day to his figures. They didn't waste time waiting for inspiration.
Enthusiasm is nothing more or less than faith in action.
Whatever course you have chosen for yourself  it will not be a chore but an adventure if you bring to it a sense of the glory of striving  if your sights are set far above the merely secure and mediocre.
Vigor is contagious  and whatever makes us either think or feel strongly adds to our power and enlarges our field of action.
Practice being excited.
It is the greatest shot of adrenaline to be doing what you've wanted to do so badly. You almost feel like you could fly without the plane.
Reason alone is insufficient to make us enthusiastic in any matter.
Nothing is so contagious as enthusiasm  it moves stones  it charms brutes. Enthusiasm is the genius of sincerity and truth accomplishes no victories without it.
Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.
The world belongs to the Enthusiast who keeps cool.
California is a fine place to live - if you happen to be an orange.
I asked a coughing friend of mine why he doesn't stop smoking. "In this town it wouldn't do any good " he explained. "I happen to be a chain breather."
I have every sympathy with the American who was so horrified by what he had read of the effects of smoking that he gave up reading.

For the colonel's lady an' Judy O'Grady Are sisters under their skins.
Fourscore and seven years ago  our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation  conceived in liberty  and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Your levellers wish to level down as far as themselves  but they cannot bear levelling up to themselves.
Men are made by nature unequal. It is vain  therefore  to treat them as if they were equal.
We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal  that they are endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights  that among these are life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
To stumble twice against the same stone is a proverbial disgrace.
To err is human  to forgive divine.
The cautious seldom err.
An error gracefully acknowledged is a victory won.
When every one is in the wrong  every one is in the right.
The man who makes no mistakes does not usually make anything.
Error will slip through a crack  while truth will stick in a doorway.
The curfew tolls the knell of parting day  The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea  The ploughman homeward plods his weary way  And leaves the world to darkness and to me.
One by one the flowers close  Lily and dewy rose Shutting their tender petals from the moon.

Each morning puts man on trial and each evening passes judgement.
I think  what has this day brought me  and what have I given it?

Sum up at night what thou has done by day.
Put off thy cares with thy clothes  so shall thy rest strengthen thy labor  and so thy labor sweeten thy rest.

The camel  at the close of day  Kneels down upon the sandy plain To have his burden lifted off And rest again. My soul  thou too should to thy knees When daylight draweth to a close  And let thy Master lift the load And grant repose.
To carry care to bed is to sleep with a pack on your back.
Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.
Don't fight with the pillow  but lay down your head And kick every worriment out of the bed.
Shed  as you do your garments  your daily sins  whether of omission or commission  and you will wake a free man  with a new life.
Thou driftest gently down the tides of sleep.
Go to bed early  get up early-this is wise.
Come Sleep! Oh Sleep  the certain knot of peace  The baiting-place of wit  the balm of woe  The poor man's wealth  the prisoner's release  The indifferent judge between the high and low.
O bed! O bed! Delicious bed! That heaven on earth to the weary head!
Fatigue is the best pillow.
